The LuxLeaks trial ended last spring with the conviction of the whistleblowers who acted in the public interest when they made us aware of the multinationals’ schemes to avoid taxes. This sentence is unacceptable. The appeal trial will be held as from 12 December in Luxembourg. A [broad citizen mobilization](http://solidarite-deltour-perrin.lu/?p=647) can contribute to obtain the release of the convicted. They must not face (in)justice alone!
