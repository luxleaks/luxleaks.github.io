## Three hearings in December 

The dates of the second LuxLeaks trial have been set: the 12, 19 and 21 of December 2016.

After being convinced on June 29th, Antoine Deltour and Raphaël Halet have each decided to appeal against their verdict. The judge has recognized them as whistleblowers (selflessness and social usefulness of their action) but he sentenced them to 12 months and 9 months suspended jail time and fines.

The Prosecutor of Luxembourg also decided to appeal the verdict. The official argument of the prosecution is not to truncate the case. A direct consequence is that the journalist Edouard Perrin goes back on the trial, while previously acquitted of all charges.

From 12 to 21 of December 2016, the appeal trial will look much like the trial from last spring. Antoine’s support committee aims to strengthen the mobilization by December to ensure Antoine’s release.
