## Official visit of the French President to Luxembourg

_Épinal, France, 4 march 2015_

Antoine Deltour support committee hopes that the official visit of the President of the French Republic to the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg on March 6 will be an opportunity to discuss in an open manner, with Luxembourg authorities, questions of tax justice among European Member States.  
Aggressive tax avoidance schemes benefiting multinational companies and approved by several countries –not only Luxembourg–, must be abandoned as soon as possible.

Thanks to the action of the French whistleblower Antoine Deltour,tax harmonization matters are now being more intensively discussed among European institutions and Member States. However, Antoine Deltour is being charged by Luxembourg authorities, even though he acted in a completely unselfish manner and as a responsible citizen.

The support committee hopes that the President of the French Republic as well as Luxembourg authorities will acknowledge that the charges against Antoine Deltour are an obvious injustice. Dropping these charges would constitute an indication of the European commitment towards more transparency and tax justice, eagerly expected by European citizens.

The action of the French whistleblower Antoine Deltour is presented on the website of his support committee: [https://support- antoine.org/en](https://support- antoine.org/en)
