## One of this year's laureates

Every year since 2008, the European Citizen Prize distinguishes people and organizations that significantly contribute to the common values of the European Union (learn more on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Citizens%27_Prize)). Antoine Deltour is one of this year’s 47 laureates, after a selection process organized by each Member State. The award ceremony will take place at the European Parliament in Brussels on 14 and 15 October.

## A recognition of Antoine's contribution

This award is a new recognition of Antoine’s contribution to the common good through its involvement in making public massive tax avoidance schemes organized by multinational companies in Europe: the impact of LuxLeaks revelations contributed to recent progress towards transparency on these long hidden practices.

Antoine Deltour’s support committee considers this distinction as a strong symbolic gesture, while Antoine remains charged by Luxembourg justice and may go to prison and face a very high fine.
