On June 29th, Antoine Deltour will appear free in front of the criminal court, accompanied by his lawyers, and so will Raphael Halet and the journalist Édouard Perrin. A high media presence is expected.

It will be important to be there with Antoine for this event. Your presence in Luxembourg, **from 2pm in front of the courthouse**, will be greatly appreciated! 

A rally is also planned in Paris **from 3pm in front of the Luxembourg embassy**, [in a “_fanzone_”](http://www.stopparadisfiscaux.fr/que-font-les-etats/l-union-europeenne/article/une-fanzone-a-paris-pour-la-fin-du) symbolizing the end of the match between multinational companies and whistleblowers.

The support committee will let you know about the verdict as soon as possible. Depending on this verdict, Antoine and his lawyers will react and comment. The Court will publish the written grounds of the judgment only a few days after it has been communicated.
