# Antoine&nbsp;Deltour Support Committee

**The Annual General Meeting of June 15, 2018, approved the dissolution of Antoine Deltour’s support committee. A huge thanks to all the people who joined us in this fight!**

## Organization

The Antoine Deltour's support committee is a non-profit organization, registered in France as an "Assocation Loi de 1901". Its objectives are:

 - to support Antoine Deltour, in regard to consequences of his whistleblower role in the LuxLeaks case,
 - to support whistleblowers in general, notably by supporting the establishment of a protection framework,
 - to denounce the implementation of tax avoidance schemes and the existence of tax havens,
 - to promote tax justice and tax harmonization among European Member States.

## Administration

The support committee was formally established during a constitutive meeting held in Épinal, France, on the 28th of Februrary 2015.  
The organization is administered by a council of twelve co-presidents, three of whom are mandated by juridical persons (CCFD Vosges, ATTAC Vosges, Épinal in transition).

The support committee is notably in charge of managing the funds raised for Antoine Deltour's defense (legal services, communication campaigns, etc.). The organization will likely be dissolved when all legal proceedings come to an end. After its dissolution, any remaining funds will be transferred to one or more organizations promoting a protection framework for whistleblowers or fighting against tax injustice and tax havens.
