        <h2>"LuxLeaks 1" publications</h2>
        <p>Some forty-odd international media companies, all of which are members of the l'International Consortium of Investigative Journalism (ICIJ), disclose hundreds of tax agreements that have been arranged by Luxembourg tax authorities on behalf of dozens of multinational companies.</p>
        <p>While he has never been directly in contact with the ICIJ, Antoine is pleased with the consequences of the consortiumâ€™s work, in agreement, for  the most part, with his original convictions.</p>
